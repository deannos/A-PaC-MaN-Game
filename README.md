# A pac-man-game

A simple console application or a quick clip game called Pacman Game in C++ was made for entertainment. Similar to the snake game, Pacman needs to be moved such that he travels along a predefined blue route before it is erased or eaten by Pacman. The game is easy to play and awards points for clearing paths as you go. 
Here ried to remake the original Pac-Man game by myself using 
C++ and SFML.

# SFML â€” Simple and Fast Multimedia Library

SFML is a simple, fast, cross-platform and object-oriented multimedia API. It provides access to windowing, graphics, audio and network. It is written in C++, and has bindings for various languages such as C, .Net, Ruby, Python.

## State of Development

SFML is currently in an interesting state of development, which can quickly become confusing if you aren't following it closely. As such we want to clarify where to get which version.

-   The [`master`](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/tree/master) branch contains work in progress for the next major version SFML 3. As such it's considered unstable, but any testing and feedback is highly appreciated.
-   The [`2.6.x`](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/tree/2.6.x) branch is the nearly complete next minor version SFML 2.6, which should be very stable, even if it hasn't been officially released yet.
-   The [`2.5.1`](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/tree/2.5.1) tag is the last official SFML release, but it lacks a lot of fixes and features that can already be found on the `2.6.x` branch.

## Download

-   You can get the latest official release on [SFML's website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
